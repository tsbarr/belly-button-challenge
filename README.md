# JS dashboard: Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset


## Background

In this project, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

This is the data challenge corresponding to Module 14 of the UofT SCS edX Data Bootcamp. 

## Result
